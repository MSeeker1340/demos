This repo contains an assortment of code snippets and demos that I wrote for my class projects, thesis and hobbies. Most of them include a Jupyter notebook that showcases their functionality.

* `autotuner`: a prototype autotuning GPU kernel for matrix multiplication that I wrote for the GPU course at Courant. It is written in PyCUDA and uses Python as a text manipulation engine to generate CUDA C kernel code. A similar demo can be found (here)[https://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/Examples/DemoMetaMatrixmulCheetah].

* `continuation`: a Julia package that implements the (numerical continuation)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_continuation] method for curve tracing in a high dimensional space.
