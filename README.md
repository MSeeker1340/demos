This repo contains an assortment of code snippets and demos that I wrote for my class projects, thesis and hobbies. Most of them include a Jupyter notebook that showcases their functionality.

* `autotuner`: a prototype autotuning GPU kernel for matrix multiplication that I wrote for the GPU course at Courant. It is written in PyCUDA and uses Python as a text manipulation engine to generate CUDA C kernel code. A similar demo can be found [here](https://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/Examples/DemoMetaMatrixmulCheetah).

* `continuation`: a Julia package that implements the [numerical continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_continuation) method for curve tracing in a high dimensional space.
